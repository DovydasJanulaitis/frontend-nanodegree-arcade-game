Description
Goal of the game is to navigate the player avatar to the top row of the game board using keyboard arrow keys. Player has to avoid bugs that run
across the screen. If player and bug collide, player has to start over from the starting position. 

To make the game more interesting, player will also have to avoid rocks that appear on the game board. Colliding with a rock will obstruct players'
movement in the desired direction.

Have fun!!!
